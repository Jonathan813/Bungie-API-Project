# Bungie API Project
This project aims to analyze game data from members of a gaming community. The data was retrieved by accessing a public API developed by Bungie, a video game company, for their popular video game called Destiny 2. In this manner, players would be able to view their account statistics and compare it to other members in their community.

## Technologies
This project utilizes Python via Jupyter Notebook. Libraries include requests, pandas, json, and access to Bungie's public API. Results were output in Excel.
